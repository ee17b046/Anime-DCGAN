# Anime DC-GAN

This is an implementation of DC-GAN for generating anime faces. 

## 

It generates anime images of size 64*64.

## 
The normal dc-gan  do not produces anime faces correctly. The images produces didn't have sharp edges which is characteristic of anime image. To solve that problem I introduced something called gradient loss which helps in producing sharper edges. 

## whats inside?
a colab notebook where i trained the whole model. It is in pytorch.
